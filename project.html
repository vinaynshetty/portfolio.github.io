    <p> ON-SOFT BIOMETRIC INFORMATION STORED IN FACE EMBEDDING </p>
    <h1><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h1>
    <p>Biometrics refers to the physiological or behavioral characteristics 
        of a person to authenticate his/her identity.A biometric system provides automatic recognition of an 
        individual based on some sort of unique feature or characteristic 
        possessed by the individual.Watermark is a digital code irremovably robustly and 
        imperceptibly embedded in the host data and typically contains 
        information about origin status and destination of the data </p>
        <h1><U>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</U></h1>
        <P>Provide secure authentication of digital documents: Biometric
            watermarking can be used to ensure the authenticity of digital
            documents and verify the identity of the user.Enhance data integrity: Biometric watermarking can be used to
            protect the data from unauthorized tampering and modification. <br>Protect confidential informtion: 
            Biometric watermarking can be used
            to protect confidential information from unauthorized access and
            disclosure. <br>Prevent identity theft: Biometric watermarking can be used to protect
            against identity theft by ensuring that only authorized users can
            access private information.</P>
            <h1><u>DESIGN AND PROCESS</u></h1>
            <P><U>Embedding Process</U> : This process is involved in the generation of a unique encrypted
                ID / master share.</P>

            <p><u>Extraction Process</u>:  This process involves extracting the fingerprint (watermark
                image) with the help of unique encrypted ID (master share).</p>

                <h1><u>CONCULSION</u></h1>
                <P>The technique of biometric watermarking is designed to avoid distortion of the original image, which is particularly important in biometrics where even the slightest variation in an image can alter a person's unique identity. Our project offers an efficient method for watermarking biometric images while causing minimal distortion to the original images. The algorithm proposed in our project uses DWT and SVD to extract distinct attributes, resulting in an effective integration of the biometric watermarking process. The master-share of each image is uniquely generated, and the algorithm is robust 
                    against several image processing attacks, as demonstrated by the experimental results.</P>
